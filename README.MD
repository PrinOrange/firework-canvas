This project provides two script files and a Canvas component, along with examples. By inserting them into your HTML, you can achieve a dynamic effect of fireworks exploding when clicking on the page.

## How to Test

Please place this directory under an **HTTP server environment**. Then, access the `index.html` file. Do not open `index.html` directly, as the browser cannot load JavaScript files in the file environment.

I recommend using the `http-server` tool. Here's how to do it:

First, install it:

```bash
npm install http-server -g
```

Then, execute the following command in this directory:

```bash
http-server
```

You can preview it in the link provided in the console.
